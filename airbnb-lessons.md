# Lessons Learned from the Airbnb

## 1. Never take on a side project that can distract you from your primary goal in any significant way

My primary goal was to become a better software engineer, and to learn more about Web technologies. By taking on their Airbnb, I devoted over 50% of my workable hours to a fun side project that went and dominated my working schedule. This was a massive mistake, and practically delayed my primary objective by a year. While I did learn how to run a small business, and a thousand other things, it came at a terrible cost.

#### What I should have done

I should have searched for the cheapest room, then sat in it and studied for the whole year, while using my evenings to develop networking connections in the IT world via startups.

## 2. Minute changes in the Market are significant. If you fail to keep up wit them and adjust accordingly, you will fail

In the beginning, I thought, "Well, I know the *average* accepted price of what I'm offering, so if I offer a bed at $x per night, with $x cleaning fee, I should be fine."

This strategy turned out to be a disaster. When data is available, you must take the full possible advantage of that data to outprice and out-maneuver your opposition. Failure to do so will innevtably cause total business failure. 

#### What I should have done

If the BNB was my primary goal, I should have tracked the pricing fluctuations of my opposition, including all additional fees like cleaning fees and taxes, and adjusted my prices to always stay a small step ahead of them

## 3. Changes is local laws and council regulations can **annihilate** your business model

When I build the BNB, if you were running a hostel (e.g. 10 single beds), Airbnb let you get away with it and so did the City Council. Two months after opening, Airbnb began taking down your listings if you were operating a hostel, since the City Council began suing them over breaking local laws. My business model was destroyed, and I went from $8000 revenue per month to barely $4000. 

#### What I should have done

I should have recognized the threat before I built the BNB as a hostel, and set the place up as private rooms with double beds. Already when I was planning the BNB, newspaper articles were saying there could be a change in local laws and city council policy. My landlord told me that "they will never do anything about it" and I believed him. That was an epic mistake. I should have planned accordingly and understood that everything can change in an instant, so you prepare for the worst case scenario and run a conservative risk-averse business strategy.
