# Study Notes

Here are a set of study notes that I took as I was studying programming. 

Since you never really stop studying programming, this list will probably grow with time.

Many of the documents here are based on courses I took at Lynda.com, so credit where credit is due.

Enjoy, and feel free to ping me at [@bengrunfeld](https://twitter.com/bengrunfeld) with any comments, questions or kvetches.
